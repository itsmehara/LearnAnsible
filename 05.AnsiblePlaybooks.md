### 5. Ansible Playbooks

Ansible playbooks are YAML files that define the tasks to be executed on managed hosts. They are central to Ansible's automation capabilities, allowing you to describe and manage configurations and deployments. In this section, we'll cover the structure and syntax of playbooks, YAML basics, plays and tasks, handlers, variables and facts, conditionals and loops, tags, roles, debugging, and including playbooks.

#### Playbook Structure and Syntax

A playbook consists of one or more plays. Each play applies tasks to a group of hosts. The basic structure is:

```yaml
---
- name: Play 1
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Task 1
      module_name:
        key: value

- name: Play 2
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Task 2
      module_name:
        key: value
```

**Example:**

```yaml
---
- name: Ensure Apache is installed and running
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present

    - name: Start Apache
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: started
```

#### YAML Basics for Writing Playbooks

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is used for writing playbooks. It is human-readable and easy to understand. Key YAML syntax elements include:

- **Dictionaries (key-value pairs):**
  ```yaml
  key: value
  ```

- **Lists:**
  ```yaml
  - item1
  - item2
  ```

- **Nested Structures:**
  ```yaml
  parent:
    child: value
  ```

- **Examples:**

  **Simple Dictionary:**
  ```yaml
  name: John Doe
  ```

  **List of Dictionaries:**
  ```yaml
  users:
    - name: Alice
      role: admin
    - name: Bob
      role: user
  ```

#### Plays and Tasks

Plays define the target hosts and the tasks to be executed on those hosts. Tasks are individual units of work that use Ansible modules.

**Example Play with Tasks:**

```yaml
---
- name: Manage Nginx on webservers
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Ensure Nginx is running
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
```

#### Handlers, and How They Differ from Tasks

Handlers are similar to tasks but are only executed when notified by other tasks. They are typically used to restart services after a configuration change.

**Example with Handlers:**

```yaml
---
- name: Configure and restart Nginx
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Copy Nginx configuration file
      copy:
        src: nginx.conf
        dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      notify: Restart Nginx

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted
```

#### Using Variables and Facts in Playbooks

Variables allow you to store values that can be reused in playbooks. Facts are variables that are automatically gathered about the managed hosts.

**Example with Variables:**

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy application
  hosts: appservers
  become: yes
  vars:
    app_name: myapp
    app_version: 1.2.3

  tasks:
    - name: Install application
      apt:
        name: "{{ app_name }}"
        version: "{{ app_version }}"
```

**Example with Facts:**

```yaml
---
- name: Gather and use facts
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Display the operating system
      debug:
        msg: "This host is running {{ ansible_os_family }}"
```

#### Conditionals and Loops

Conditionals allow tasks to be executed based on certain conditions. Loops allow tasks to be repeated for multiple items.

**Example with Conditionals:**

```yaml
---
- name: Conditional task execution
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx on Debian-based systems
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian'
```

**Example with Loops:**

```yaml
---
- name: Install multiple packages
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install packages
      apt:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop:
        - nginx
        - mysql-server
        - php
```

#### Tags and Their Usage in Playbooks

Tags allow you to run specific parts of a playbook. Tasks can be tagged, and then executed selectively using the `--tags` option.

**Example with Tags:**

```yaml
---
- name: Install and configure webserver
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      tags: install

    - name: Configure Nginx
      template:
        src: nginx.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      tags: configure

    - name: Start Nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
      tags: start
```

To run only the install tasks:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags install
```

#### Using Roles to Organize Playbooks

Roles allow you to organize playbooks into reusable components. A role typically includes tasks, handlers, variables, templates, and files.

**Directory Structure for Roles:**

```
roles/
  common/
    tasks/
      main.yml
    handlers/
      main.yml
    vars/
      main.yml
    templates/
      nginx.conf.j2
    files/
      myfile.txt
```

**Example Role Usage:**

```yaml
---
- name: Apply common configuration
  hosts: all
  roles:
    - common
```

**Example Role Definition:**

**roles/common/tasks/main.yml:**

```yaml
---
- name: Install common packages
  apt:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  loop:
    - curl
    - git
```

#### Debugging Playbooks and Using the Debug Module

Debugging is crucial for troubleshooting issues in playbooks. The `debug` module helps you display variables and messages.

**Example Using Debug Module:**

```yaml
---
- name: Debugging example
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Show a message
      debug:
        msg: "This is a debug message"

    - name: Show a variable value
      debug:
        var: ansible_distribution
```

**Using `ansible-playbook` with Debugging Options:**

- **Verbose Mode:** Show detailed output during playbook execution.
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook playbook.yml -vvv
  ```

- **Check Mode:** Test the playbook without making changes.
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook playbook.yml --check
  ```

#### Importing and Including Playbooks

You can import or include other playbooks and tasks to modularize your playbooks.

**Example of Importing Tasks:**

```yaml
---
- name: Main playbook
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - import_tasks: tasks/common.yml
    - import_tasks: tasks/webserver.yml
```

**Example of Including Playbooks:**

```yaml
---
- name: Main playbook
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - include_tasks: tasks/common.yml
    - include_tasks: tasks/webserver.yml
```

**Differences Between `import_tasks` and `include_tasks`:**
- **`import_tasks`**: Tasks are statically included at playbook parse time.
- **`include_tasks`**: Tasks are dynamically included at runtime.

**Example Task File (`tasks/common.yml`):**

```yaml
---
- name: Ensure common packages are installed
  apt:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  loop:
    - vim
    - htop
```

By mastering the structure and components of Ansible playbooks, 
you can create powerful automation scripts that manage complex deployments and configurations. 

This knowledge allows you to effectively organize, reuse, and troubleshoot your automation workflows, 
making your infrastructure management more efficient and scalable.
