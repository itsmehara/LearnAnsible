### 7. Advanced Ansible Playbook Techniques

In this section, we will explore advanced techniques in Ansible playbooks, including using templates with Jinja2, encrypting sensitive data with Vault, managing playbooks and roles with Ansible Tower/AWX, asynchronous actions and polling, and error handling and retries. These techniques enhance the functionality, security, and efficiency of your Ansible automation.

#### Templates with Jinja2

Jinja2 is a templating engine for Python, and Ansible uses it for dynamic content in templates. Templates allow you to create files with variables that are populated during playbook execution.

**Example Jinja2 Template:**

**nginx.conf.j2:**

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name {{ server_name }};

    location / {
        root {{ document_root }};
        index index.html;
    }
}
```

**Playbook Using the Template:**

```yaml
---
- name: Configure Nginx with template
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  vars:
    server_name: example.com
    document_root: /var/www/html
  tasks:
    - name: Copy Nginx configuration file
      template:
        src: nginx.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      notify: Restart Nginx

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted
```

**Explanation:**

- The `nginx.conf.j2` template contains placeholders for `server_name` and `document_root`.
- The `template` module copies the template to the destination and replaces the placeholders with variable values.

#### Using Vault for Encrypting Sensitive Data

Ansible Vault allows you to encrypt sensitive data such as passwords and keys, keeping them secure while being used in playbooks.

**Creating an Encrypted File:**

```bash
ansible-vault create secret.yml
```

**Example Encrypted File (`secret.yml`):**

```yaml
vault_mysql_password: "s3cr3t"
```

**Using Encrypted Variables in Playbooks:**

```yaml
---
- name: Use Ansible Vault encrypted variables
  hosts: dbservers
  become: yes
  vars_files:
    - secret.yml
  tasks:
    - name: Install MySQL
      apt:
        name: mysql-server
        state: present

    - name: Create MySQL user
      mysql_user:
        name: dbuser
        password: "{{ vault_mysql_password }}"
        priv: '*.*:ALL'
        state: present
```

**Editing an Encrypted File:**

```bash
ansible-vault edit secret.yml
```

**Running a Playbook with Vault:**

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

#### Ansible Tower/AWX for Managing Playbooks and Roles

Ansible Tower (commercial) and AWX (open-source) provide a web-based interface to manage Ansible playbooks, inventories, and roles. They offer scheduling, logging, and role-based access control.

**Setting Up AWX:**

1. **Install Docker and Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y docker.io docker-compose
   ```

2. **Clone AWX Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ansible/awx.git
   cd awx/installer
   ```

3. **Configure AWX:**
   Edit the `inventory` file to set necessary configurations like PostgreSQL password.

4. **Install AWX:**
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory install.yml
   ```

5. **Access AWX:**
   Open a browser and go to `http://<your_server_ip>` to access the AWX web interface.

**Using AWX/Tower:**

- **Create an Inventory:** Define the hosts and groups.
- **Create Credentials:** Store credentials securely.
- **Create a Project:** Link to a source control repository containing your playbooks.
- **Create a Job Template:** Define a playbook to run, the inventory, and credentials to use.
- **Run Jobs:** Execute playbooks through the web interface.

#### Asynchronous Actions and Polling

Asynchronous actions allow tasks to run without waiting for completion, which is useful for long-running tasks.

**Example of Asynchronous Task:**

```yaml
---
- name: Asynchronous task example
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Run long task asynchronously
      command: /bin/sleep 300
      async: 600
      poll: 10
      register: async_task

    - name: Check on asynchronous task
      async_status:
        jid: "{{ async_task.ansible_job_id }}"
      register: job_result
      until: job_result.finished
      retries: 30
      delay: 10
```

**Explanation:**

- The `async` parameter specifies the maximum runtime for the task.
- The `poll` parameter defines how frequently Ansible checks the task status.
- The `async_status` module checks the status of the asynchronous task.

#### Error Handling and Retries

Ansible provides mechanisms to handle errors and retry tasks in case of failures.

**Example of Error Handling and Retries:**

```yaml
---
- name: Error handling and retries example
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Try to install a package
      apt:
        name: non_existent_package
        state: present
      ignore_errors: yes
      register: result

    - name: Retry a task
      command: /bin/false
      retries: 5
      delay: 2
      register: retry_result
      until: retry_result.rc == 0

    - name: Check result and fail if necessary
      fail:
        msg: "Package installation failed"
      when: result.failed
```

**Explanation:**

- `ignore_errors: yes` allows the playbook to continue even if the task fails.
- `retries` and `delay` parameters enable retries for a task.
- The `fail` module is used to fail the playbook with a custom message if a condition is met.

**Advanced Error Handling Example:**

**Playbook with Advanced Error Handling:**

```yaml
---
- name: Advanced error handling
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install a package with error handling
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      register: install_result
      retries: 3
      delay: 5
      until: install_result is succeeded
      ignore_errors: yes

    - name: Check if installation succeeded
      debug:
        msg: "Nginx installed successfully"
      when: install_result is succeeded

    - name: Fail the playbook if installation failed
      fail:
        msg: "Nginx installation failed after multiple attempts"
      when: install_result is failed
```

By mastering these advanced techniques, you can create more dynamic, secure, and robust Ansible playbooks. 

These techniques help you handle complex scenarios, 
secure sensitive data, manage large-scale deployments, and handle errors gracefully, 
making your automation more efficient and reliable.
