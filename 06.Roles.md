### 6. Roles

Roles are a powerful feature in Ansible that allow you to organize your playbooks and reusable components into discrete units. This organization simplifies complex playbooks and encourages reuse of code. In this section, we will delve into creating and using roles, the role directory structure, role dependencies and requirements, and using Ansible Galaxy for role management.

#### Creating and Using Roles

Roles enable you to break down your playbooks into reusable components. Each role can contain tasks, variables, handlers, templates, files, and more. To create a role, use the `ansible-galaxy` command.

**Creating a Role:**

```bash
ansible-galaxy init myrole
```

This command creates a directory structure for the role `myrole`.

**Using Roles in Playbooks:**

You include roles in your playbooks using the `roles` keyword.

**Example Playbook Using a Role:**

```yaml
---
- name: Apply myrole to all hosts
  hosts: all
  roles:
    - myrole
```

#### Role Directory Structure

The directory structure of a role is standardized, making it easier to organize and share roles. Here is an example of the directory structure created by `ansible-galaxy init myrole`:

```
myrole/
  ├── README.md
  ├── defaults/
  │   └── main.yml
  ├── files/
  ├── handlers/
  │   └── main.yml
  ├── meta/
  │   └── main.yml
  ├── tasks/
  │   └── main.yml
  ├── templates/
  ├── tests/
  │   ├── inventory
  │   └── test.yml
  └── vars/
      └── main.yml
```

**Description of Role Components:**

- **README.md**: Documentation for the role.
- **defaults/main.yml**: Default variables for the role.
- **files/**: Static files that can be copied to the target machines.
- **handlers/main.yml**: Handlers used in the role.
- **meta/main.yml**: Role metadata, including dependencies.
- **tasks/main.yml**: Main list of tasks to be executed by the role.
- **templates/**: Templates that can be dynamically populated with variables.
- **tests/**: Test inventory and playbook to verify the role.
- **vars/main.yml**: Variables for the role.

#### Role Dependencies and Requirements

Roles can depend on other roles. You can specify these dependencies in the `meta/main.yml` file.

**Example `meta/main.yml` with Dependencies:**

```yaml
---
dependencies:
  - { role: common, vars: { some_var: 3 } }
  - { role: apache }
```

In this example, the role depends on the `common` and `apache` roles. Ansible will ensure these roles are applied before the current role.

**Role Dependencies Use Cases:**

- **Modularization**: Breaking down complex setups into smaller, manageable roles.
- **Reusability**: Using common roles across multiple playbooks.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding implementation details within roles.

#### Using Ansible Galaxy for Role Management

Ansible Galaxy is a repository for finding, sharing, and downloading roles. It simplifies the management and reuse of roles across different projects.

**Installing Roles from Ansible Galaxy:**

```bash
ansible-galaxy install username.rolename
```

**Example of Installing a Role:**

```bash
ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.apache
```

This command installs the `apache` role created by `geerlingguy`.

**Using Installed Roles in Playbooks:**

```yaml
---
- name: Apply galaxy role
  hosts: all
  roles:
    - geerlingguy.apache
```

**Creating and Sharing Roles on Ansible Galaxy:**

To share a role on Ansible Galaxy, you need to create an account on the [Ansible Galaxy website](https://galaxy.ansible.com/) and upload your role.

1. **Login to Ansible Galaxy:**
   ```bash
   ansible-galaxy login
   ```

2. **Publish the Role:**
   ```bash
   ansible-galaxy import username rolename
   ```

**Example Role Usage with Ansible Galaxy:**

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy webserver using roles
  hosts: webservers
  roles:
    - { role: geerlingguy.apache, become: yes }
    - { role: geerlingguy.mysql, become: yes }
```

**Example of a Custom Role (`myrole`) with Various Components:**

**Directory Structure:**

```
myrole/
  ├── defaults/
  │   └── main.yml
  ├── files/
  │   └── index.html
  ├── handlers/
  │   └── main.yml
  ├── meta/
  │   └── main.yml
  ├── tasks/
  │   └── main.yml
  ├── templates/
  │   └── nginx.conf.j2
  └── vars/
      └── main.yml
```

**defaults/main.yml:**

```yaml
---
# Default variables
myrole_variable: "default_value"
```

**files/index.html:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Welcome</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to myrole managed server!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

**handlers/main.yml:**

```yaml
---
# Handlers
- name: restart nginx
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: restarted
```

**meta/main.yml:**

```yaml
---
# Meta information
dependencies:
  - role: common
```

**tasks/main.yml:**

```yaml
---
# Tasks
- name: Install nginx
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present

- name: Copy index.html
  copy:
    src: index.html
    dest: /var/www/html/index.html

- name: Configure nginx
  template:
    src: nginx.conf.j2
    dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  notify: restart nginx

- name: Start nginx
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: started
```

**templates/nginx.conf.j2:**

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;

    location / {
        root /var/www/html;
        index index.html;
    }
}
```

**vars/main.yml:**

```yaml
---
# Variables
myrole_variable: "overridden_value"
```

**Playbook to Use the Custom Role:**

```yaml
---
- name: Apply custom role
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  roles:
    - myrole
```

By understanding how to create, use, and manage roles in Ansible, you can significantly improve the organization and reusability of your automation scripts. 
Roles allow you to encapsulate and share configurations and tasks, making your playbooks more maintainable and scalable. 

Using Ansible Galaxy further enhances this by providing a platform to discover and reuse community-contributed roles.
