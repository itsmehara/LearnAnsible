### 13. Loops and Conditionals in Ansible Playbooks

Loops and conditionals in Ansible playbooks allow for more dynamic and flexible task execution. This section covers using different loop constructs (`with_items`, `with_dict`, `with_nested`, etc.), conditional statements (`when`), and looping with conditionals. Detailed step-by-step instructions and examples are provided for clear understanding.

#### Using `with_items`

The `with_items` loop allows you to iterate over a list of items, applying the same task to each item.

**Example: Installing Multiple Packages**

```yaml
---
- name: Install multiple packages
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install packages
      apt:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop:
        - vim
        - git
        - curl
```

#### Using `with_dict`

The `with_dict` loop allows you to iterate over key-value pairs in a dictionary.

**Example: Creating Users with Specific Attributes**

```yaml
---
- name: Create users
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Add users
      user:
        name: "{{ item.key }}"
        uid: "{{ item.value.uid }}"
        group: "{{ item.value.group }}"
      loop: "{{ lookup('dict', users) }}"
      vars:
        users:
          alice:
            uid: 1001
            group: staff
          bob:
            uid: 1002
            group: admin
```

#### Using `with_nested`

The `with_nested` loop allows you to perform tasks with combinations of items from multiple lists.

**Example: Creating Directories with Permissions**

```yaml
---
- name: Create directories with permissions
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure directories exist with correct permissions
      file:
        path: "/home/{{ item.0 }}/{{ item.1 }}"
        state: directory
        mode: "{{ item.2 }}"
      with_nested:
        - [ 'alice', 'bob' ]
        - [ 'docs', 'photos' ]
        - [ '0755', '0700' ]
```

#### Conditional Statements (`when`)

Conditional statements in Ansible are used to execute tasks based on certain conditions.

**Example: Conditional Package Installation**

```yaml
---
- name: Install Apache on Debian-based systems
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
```

**Example: Conditional User Creation**

```yaml
---
- name: Create users based on variable
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Add user Alice if create_alice is true
      user:
        name: alice
        state: present
      when: create_alice | default(false)
```

#### Looping with Conditionals

Combining loops with conditionals can further enhance the flexibility of playbooks.

**Example: Installing Packages Conditionally**

```yaml
---
- name: Conditionally install packages
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install packages if not already installed
      apt:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop:
        - vim
        - git
        - curl
      when: ansible_facts['pkg_mgr'] == 'apt'
```

**Example: Creating Users Based on Conditions**

```yaml
---
- name: Conditionally create users
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Add users based on conditions
      user:
        name: "{{ item.name }}"
        state: present
      loop:
        - { name: 'alice', condition: true }
        - { name: 'bob', condition: false }
      when: item.condition
```

#### Using `with_fileglob`

The `with_fileglob` loop allows you to iterate over files matching a pattern.

**Example: Deploying Multiple Config Files**

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy config files
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Copy configuration files
      copy:
        src: "{{ item }}"
        dest: /etc/myapp/
      with_fileglob:
        - /path/to/configs/*.conf
```

#### Using `with_sequence`

The `with_sequence` loop generates a sequence of numbers or letters.

**Example: Creating Multiple Directories**

```yaml
---
- name: Create numbered directories
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Create directories
      file:
        path: "/var/myapp/dir{{ item }}"
        state: directory
      with_sequence: start=1 end=5
```

#### Using `with_together`

The `with_together` loop allows you to iterate over multiple lists together.

**Example: Adding Users with Home Directories**

```yaml
---
- name: Add users with home directories
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Create users
      user:
        name: "{{ item.0 }}"
        home: "{{ item.1 }}"
      with_together:
        - [ 'alice', 'bob' ]
        - [ '/home/alice', '/home/bob' ]
```

### Conclusion

By mastering loops and conditionals in Ansible playbooks, you can create more dynamic, efficient, and reusable configurations. 
These constructs provide powerful ways to automate complex tasks, ensuring that your infrastructure is managed consistently and effectively.
